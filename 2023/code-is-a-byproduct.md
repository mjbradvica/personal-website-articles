# Code is a By-product

"Control, vision, determination. These are the three fundamental components of the new generation race car driver. Speed is a by-product."

The line from the move Gone in 60 Seconds perfectly encapsulates the essence of software engineering. Except instead of driving fast, we are producing code. In the scene, Randall Raines played by Nicholas Cage tries to explain to new drivers that going fast is not your main objective. He talks about the pre-cursors to driving, that if perfected, will result in the speed the driver desires.

Software engineering is no different. Except instead of control, vision, and determination, the three fundamental components of software are tooling, testing, and DevOps. Every successful project has these three items in some form. Any modern application is gambling with the success of the project they are not built into the application from day one.

## Tooling

Tooling may relate to any of the following:

- IDE or Editor and any respective plugins and settings files
- Documentation either done manually or automatically such as Storybook
- Code Analysis tools such as the .NET Analyzers, ESLint, or Prettier

## Testing

An automated suite of well written tests is the best insurance your development team can buy. A well written test suite will:

- Force your team to write code to be tested, requiring a heightened quality
- Provide you with a feedback loop for changes and refactoring
- Reduce the load on manual testing, in turn reducing costs

## DevOps

DevOps is a large umbrella that may contain but is not limited to:

- Source Control via Git or another tool such as SVN
- Automated pipelines that will build, test, and deploy libraries and applications
- A sanity check against self-centered development (it works on my machine)

## Control your Code or be Controlled

Failing to get these topics correct in a project will result in project failure or an application that is severely hampered by a lack of infrastructure. As a project lead, you should stress over these topics more than the code itself--as these topics will dictate what code is ultimately produced and shipped.

The code in your application is not the most important item, but it is the most pertinent.
