- IDE or Editor and any respective plugins
- Documentation either done manually or automatically such as Storybook

- Force your team to write code to be tested, requiring a heightened quality
- Provide you with a feedback loop for changes and refactoring
- Reduce the load on manual testing, in turn reducing costs

DevOps is a large umbrella that may contain but is not limited to:

- Source Control
- Automated pipelines that will build, test, and deploy libraries and applications
- A sanity check against self-centered development (it works on my machine)

The code in your application is not the most important item, but it is the most pertinent.
