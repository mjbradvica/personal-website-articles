# Don't Have (Software) Babies

## Attachment leads to emotion

A major impediment to your career is getting overly attached to a feature, library, or application. Especially ones that we have invested a significant amount of time into. There is a reason for this-when we invest time and energy into something, our perception about it changes. You and your organization should avoid this.

Bad things can happen in your organization when people get too attached:

- People will code to make things purposely complicated. And only they know how it works
- Consistent refactoring and churn when resources could be allocated to items with greater need
- People will attempt to make any excuse why X, Y, and Z are necessary. Adding to complexity
- Something tries to make a use case for a technology when an alternate one would do a better job

## Be Your Biggest Critic

Ownership is not a bad thing. Taking the lead and owning a piece of an application can be a good thing. When you write something-you are its-and your biggest critic. There is tremendous potential in you being able to freely and openly denigrate your own work. This can lead to a better overall product!

## It will probably get replaced anyway

Nothing lasts forever-especially in software. You should stay away from getting attached to anything in software because there is a very high chance it will be replaced in the future. There are some edge cases, but the only consistency in software is that something new and shiny is on the horizon.

Date your software. Don't marry it.
