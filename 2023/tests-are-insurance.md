# Tests Are Insurance

## No One Likes Insurance

The reality of life is that people dislike insurance. We dislike buying, paying, and dealing with all types of insurance. However, all of us accept the fact that insurance is required. We need it for many situations in life. The thought of going a day without it would put undue stress on us. In certain cases, insurance is a life-saver. Testing in software is no different. Developers, including this one, dislike writing and dealing with tests. But deep-down inside, tests are no different than insurance. We all accept the reality that just like insurance, tests are a necessity in modern software development.

We have collectively agreed as a society that insurance is needed for many purchases. This includes:

- Purchasing a car or home
- Enrolling in a higher education establishment
- When starting certain businesses
- Professionals in high scrutinized professions

In the same vain that large purchases or events with risk require insurance, software requires tests:

- Insurance is paying now for issues that may happen in the future. In software, issues _will_ happen.
- The more an asset depreciates in value, the less you need to spend on insurance. In software, costs for testing are up front in setting up infrastructure and getting developers accustomed. As the project matures, the costs of testing will naturally reside.
- The more expertise you have with an asset or subject, the more you realize how much you can and can not get away with. In software, developers get more accustomed to the process and better at writing tests, thus, reducing costs.

## Tests Are Your Insurance

When you as a software engineer write a test, be it unit, integration, or end-to-end, you are investing in your applications' future. The time and effort put forth will pay dividends later when someone needs to modify the software.

- Tests allow us to refactor at will with the confidence behavior will stay the same
- Tests describe behavior to other developers, acting as another form of documentation
- Tests allow us to automate things in ways manual QA can not
- Tests can alleviate, but not fully replace manual testing

A failure to implement automated testing in any project is a risk, similar to skimping on insurance. You are saving money in the _hope_ that nothing terribly bad will happen in the future. That is not a risk that you as a developer should be willing to take. Tests may be frustrating to write and maintain, but they _always_ pay the bill in an applications' lifecycle. The larger and older the application gets, the more testing pays for itself. Once one is able to understand and appreciate the benefit and buffer that automated testing gives you, the cost ceases to become an influence.
