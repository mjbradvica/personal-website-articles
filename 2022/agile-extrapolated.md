# Agile Extrapolated

In a previous article, I define Agile as:

1. Make a change to anything
2. Did the change work?
3. Yes, repeat step 1
4. No, revert the change, and repeat step 1

Yes, it is that easy in concept. It is also that hard in reality.

## Agile Is Not

1. Saying you are agile to please the CEO
2. Getting your Scrum Master certification
3. Waterfall in 2 week sprints
4. Asking for, "When will it be finished?"
