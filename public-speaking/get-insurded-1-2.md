# Get Insured

## Title

Hello Everyone,

Thanks for having me this evening, shout out to Brian and the rest of everyone who makes ODevs a reality. This isn't free money or time-wise to put on to host. So I appreciate everything you do.

This talk is technically a part 1 of 2. Assuming that Brian doesn't hate me in the end--I'll do the second part at a future meetup.

The name of this talk is, "Get insured-or crash the Car", and yes, I will be asking you if you would like to buy an extended warranty for your vehicle today.

Except in this case, the vehicle in question is your application or suite of applications your company maintains.

## Personal

Real quick, who am I?

My name is Michael Bradvica (my last name is Croatian in case you weren't wondering), I'm a full-stack developer at the theme here in town with the dolphins and animals. It's the one that starts with a "U".

And below you can see the worthless pieces of paper that I hold.

I'll save the shameless plugs for later on in the presentation when I can keep the slide up during Q&A.

## Shameless Plugs

If you want to read more about what I do; I blog @ michaelbradvica.com

If you are a dotnet developer, I have a few libraries that I maintain from my GitHub. Most of these entail giving you a foundation in your back-end code. I have done all the dirty boilerplate for you, and you get to focus on more important things.

Software is an immature industry
Modern software is even more immature
Only had SPA frameworks since 2010ish

We can see this through personal and work interactions
"I've always done it this way", "I'm the boss", "it's worked before"
No the words of either a mature or confident person

Software Engineering is not a physical science
Not based on laws of physics or hard mathematics

Programming is, boolean logic, memory allocation, n notation

It behooves us as software engineers, not developers, no coders.

You need to remove that mode of thinking from every groove in your brain, you are an engineer, not a developer. Developers are cheap, anyone can go to a coding camp. (I would know, I went to one.)

We as an industry need to move software engineering from an opinion based one, to cold, soulless, "up is up, down is down, and gravity is undefeated" one.

First thing we can do is look at other more mature industries and steal from them.

Finance, banking, and the focus of this talk insurance.
