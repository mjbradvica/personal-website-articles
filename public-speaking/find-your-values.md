# Find Your Values

Software is an immature industry
Modern software is even more immature
Only had SPA frameworks since 2010ish

We can see this through personal and work interactions
"I've always done it this way", "I'm the boss", "it's worked before"
No the words of either a mature or confident person

Software Engineering is not a physical science
Not based on laws of physics or hard mathematics

Programming is, boolean logic, memory allocation, n notation

It behooves us as software engineers, not developers, no coders.

You need to remove that mode of thinking from every groove in your brain, you are an engineer, not a developer. Developers are cheap, anyone can go to a coding camp. (I would know, I went to one.)

We as an industry need to move software engineering from an opinion based one, to cold, soulless, "up is up, down is down, and gravity is undefeated" one.

First thing we can do is look at other more mature industries and steal from them.

Finance, banking, and the focus of this talk insurance.
