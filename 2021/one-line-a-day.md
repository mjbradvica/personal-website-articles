# One Line A Day

An active software application is a never ending task subject to entropy.

- We write a messy function and forget to refactor later.
- A junior developers' code is not given a proper code review.
- Some feature is completed under a time crunch.

The only way to actively combat this entropy is to set aside time as a team to tackle technical debt and refactor parts of the application. This inevitable wall of work gets pushed back further and further until it becomes unavoidable.

This pain can be mitigated.

The ultimate solution would be to just write better code in the first place. But that concept is unable to account for differences in skill level and people's development progress during their career.

Instead, focus your efforts on one line of code every day, and improve it. One line may be functionally insignificant in a modern application. But one line of code is one more line than the previous day. And you are not the only developer.

Assuming your team has ten developers:

1 line x 10 developers x ~261 work days a year = 2,610 lines of code a year

Some days it will be zero lines, and other days it may be in tens or hundreds of lines. The important thing is that you are actively improving your application, not passively.

You are setting the a tone for the rest of your team to follow. It shows that you care at both the macro and micro level.

Development is imperfect. Taking five minutes a day to invest in the quality of your application will always pay dividends.
