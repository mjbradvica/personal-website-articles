# Alternatives to Blazor

Choosing a front-end technology today can be an exciting and anxious undertaking. The ability to offer a new experience to your customers in form of a modern technology can be the spark to push new sales and clients. The hard part about having so many opportunities is the possibility of being overwhelmed by options. Your choice is technology is only one part in delivering a well-engineered solution to your customers. Having a clearly defined architecture, rock-solid coding standards, and a competent team will do more good than your choice of framework.

## ASP.NET Offerings

The non-Blazor offerings in the .NET space are Razor Pages and traditional MVC. These are inheritably stateless offerings because they are designed to send a request to your back-end via HTTP whenever a state change is required. Both of these technologies do not fall under the SPA (single page application) category. They offer a more traditional user experience where simplicity is the most desired attribute.

### Core MVC

ASP.NET Core MVC is carried over from previous versions of the ASP.NET framework. If you have developers who have experience with older version of ASP.NET, it was probably in the form of MVC. MVC has not changed much and that was intended to keep it familiar and compatible with the thousands of older MVC apps that exist in the .NET space. The choice between MVC and Razor Pages is semantic at best. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages that are developer specific. Choosing MVC or Razor Pages will have zero impact on your customers.

### Core Razor Pages

Razor Pages is a new but familiar offering from Microsoft in the web application space. It is the updated and better form of Web Pages that existed in older versions of the .NET framework. It uses the same concept of Web Pages with each view having a code behind file, but uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern of binding each view to a view model now. This allows for a much more testable application that was impossible with older iteration of Web Pages. If your developers preferred the concept of Web Pages or the MVVM pattern, then Razor Pages will make more sense for you.

### The Core Truth

ASP.NET Core is far more powerful and flexible option compared to its older .NET Framework versions. Microsoft has streamlined the tooling and middle-ware experience considerately-making the development experience much more enjoyable and faster than before. If a static website is what you need, Core MVC and Razor Pages offer one of the fastest and easiest development cycles available. Being Microsoft technologies, they blend in effortlessly to Azure and can be deployed to a cloud environment easily.

## Javascript Frameworks

Moving back into the single-page application space, but utilizing Javascript instead of WebAssembly. Your two biggest options are going to be React and Angular. Similar to Blazor, they are component based frameworks that can give you a rich user-experience through a stateless architecture. Both are backed by large companies, have a huge user-base, and offer ample tooling and support. The choice between Angular, React, or another framework will depends on your existing talent's abilities and past experience.

### React

Backed and used by Facebook, React is designed as a "view engine" instead of a fully formed framework. It is initially easier to learn than Angular because React itself is only concerned with constructing views. React still has the ability to do anything in the development space that Angular can do. Instead of going by rigid framework guidelines, React allows developers to pick and choose what parts they want their application. React comes "as is" and forces you to make development decisions as you go, the tradeoff being that its easier grasp the basics compared to large frameworks.

### Angular

Sponsored by Google, Angular is the other large fish in the ocean of Javascript web frameworks. Adopting Angular is a much more "structured" decision. Compared to React which leaves certain choices to the developer, Angular has a much more rigged structure to how an application is constructed. This has certain advantages and disadvantages to it. Angular forces you to use Typescript which is a far safer programming language than raw Javascript. However as a framework, Angular has a steeper initial learning curve than React.

### Vue & Friends

Other Javascript based web frameworks available may be in the form of Vue.js, Ember, Polymer, Aurelia and many more. These do not have the same level of tooling, support, or community size compared to React or Angular, but that does not disqualify them from being viable options for your web application needs. All software projects are independent of others, and each has its own specific requirements at both the functional and non-functional level.

Your choice of choosing a particular Javascript framework will ultimately be decided upon by the needs of your application and the abilities of your team and their comfort with a certain technology. Your choice of React, Core Razor Pages, or Angular is secondary to the engineering prowess of your developers. No framework is a guaranteed pathway to success. Only through well thought out engineering and good decision making will your needs a reality.
