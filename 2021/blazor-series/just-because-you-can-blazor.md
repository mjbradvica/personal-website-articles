# Just Because You Can, Does Not Mean You Should

"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."

If you have seen the movie Jurassic Park, you may be familiar with the line above. In the scene, Dr. Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum tries to explain to the owner of Jurassic Park that dinosaurs went extinct on purpose. He attempts to raise the serious moral an ethical issues surrounding not just bring back numerous dead species. But brining back creatures with large appetites and very pointy teeth. Ultimately the worst case scenario occurs when the park systems fail, and the dinosaurs begin rampaging around the island hungry for fresh scientist meat. Software is no different. As engineers, we have many options available to us. It is our due diligence to recuse ourselves from implementing ill-sighted solutions.

Blazor presents it own sets of difficulties that until now have not existed. This is the first time that we have been able to combine a responsive and dynamic web framework with a fully featured language such as C#. Until now, we have JavaScript and the slightly less frustrating TypeScript. The key difference being that JS and TS are scripting languages, where C# is an application language. This is magnified with the dotnet ecosystem that exists around C# where many more things are possible compared to just a couple of years ago.

When you a designing a component, ask yourself the following questions:

Does this component enable an end-user to view or interact with my application?

And...

Am I enabling the end-user to do so in the simplest way possible?

This definition does not make any assumption regarding the following:

- How data in the application is persisted

- How data in the application is retrieved

- How the UI deals with logic

Good engineering is simple and easy to understand. Just because a complicated problem exists does not equal and equally complicated solution is required. Blazor is wonderful because we can develop and entire solution in a single language. This does not give us the luxury of forgoing our engineering prowess that has served us in the past.

Blazor for developers is both a blessing and a potential curse. It allows us to employ a single technology stack that keeps development friction to a minimum. It also gives us a modern framework to build web applications that have the durability to last for years. What it also does it open us up to new ways of creating complicated and frustrating solutions. Keep the responsibility of Blazor to interacting with the end-user and you won't end up with a malfunctioning theme park.
