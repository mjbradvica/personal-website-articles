# Embracing Component Architecture

Embracing Blazor means accepting a new paradigm for developing web applications. Traditional web development mostly revolved around the MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), or some slight variation of the two. These paradigms still live on today as viable options for developing web applications. Blazor and other modern component frameworks such as Angular or React, are component based. This type of architecture blends certain responsibilities of what would traditionally be isolated out into separate concerns. Employing Blazor means letting go of traditional development methodologies-putting the component as the key first-class citizen in your application.

When I first ventured into component-based frameworks, I made the mistake of forcing old architecture ideas. This was a mistake as I learned that components have no real parody to older concepts. This stems from the idea that Blazor, like Angular and React is stateful, where MVC or Razor Pages is stateless. Trying to force stateless architecture into something that assumes state was not a good idea. I attempted to pull out logic into "handlers" or controllers, and create view-Models for each component. It was messy, convoluted, and didn't solve any of my problems. It was when I started to embrace components as isolated and self-contained did everything start to make sense.

Imagine your application as a jig-saw puzzle. Each piece can live by itself. It can be combined with other pieces that fit together to create small understandable sections. When the puzzle is completed, every piece comes together to create the final product. The puzzle is a **composition** of all its individual pieces. Component based frameworks are no different than a jig-saw puzzle. Each component can live by itself. You can pass data to it via its parameters and it may render said parameters, it may render a button to be clicked, or it may fetch some data that may be passed to another component. The key idea being that every component contains all of its logic necessary to do its intended purpose.

The glaring issue with components is that while separation of concerns is less of an issue, it still **is** an issue. The biggest issue arises with components that are too big and have too many responsibilities. Much of what responsibility should and should not be in a component is a exercise in learning and experience. Some general rules to follow is that even though Blazor is a stateful framework, most components should be stateless. Stateless components are simpler and therefor, easier to test. Components that deal with fetching or posting data from an API are typically separate from components that deal with the UI. Instilling a culture of adaptability and a willing to learn and refactor accordingly will ensure that your team maintains a healthy application.

Component based architecture can be a frustrating concept to initially grasp. If your development history is based in traditional web development methods where separation of concerns is supreme, components can come as a bit of a surprise. The best action is to embrace this new architecture, not trying to force incompatible methods into this new paradigm. Embrace components as a self-contained unit of work that can live by itself, but can also place nicely with others. The more you become comfortable with this new methodology, the more you will understand how to structure and balance your components. Blazor is a great framework, but only when you keep to the design intent of the framework.
